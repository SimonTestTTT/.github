Real-time locating systems enable real-time tracking of the location of objects and new applications such as automated guided vehicle systems (AGVs). But locating solutions are often offered proprietarily as a closed system and can therefore not be used in an interoperable way with other solutions. But not with TRUMPF: With our hardware, software, consultation and services, integrators or infrastructure providers can offer flexible complete solutions for real-time locating, based on <a href="https://www.omlox.com" target="_blank">omlox</a>, the world's first open locating standard. With ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, objects can be located with an accuracy of up to 10cm. Its low power consumption ensures minimal interferences allowing for coexistence with existing infrastructure.

Within omlox core zone, Coriva is the solution module for modern real-time-loacting-system (RTLS) infrastructure from TRUMPF: Fixed CorivaSatellites communicate with mobile CorivaTags; the locating data is then computed by the powerful and flexible locating software CorivaEngine , which applications can access. Paving the way to modern and transparent goods and logistics flows!
